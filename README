
High-load shaper for Linux.

Hangs several thousands of user sessions on one gigabit channel.

Uses third-party utility: http://vcalinus.gemenii.ro/?p=9 - I've some patched it for my own needs but itt still works fine.

Example of use:

 - gcc prefixtree.c -o prefixtree
 - put networks list into 'networks' file
 - just execute php -q shaper.php
   It will write configuration file for /sbin/tc and put it to tc

Dependencies:

 - needs some functions from my php-lib set: https://github.com/fycth/php-lib
 - you need to inform the script about how to grab ID's and IP's of your clients. The code tries to grab it from MySQL database.
   So you need proper MySQL database structure or you can put it into the script some another way.
